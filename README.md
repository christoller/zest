## **What is it?**

Food Costly is an recipe management app designed to help users design, cost and store recipes. The main feature of the app are:

### **Recipe Builder**

An easy to use template will be provided for users to create consistent, easy to read recipes (and printer friendly). The recipes will be stored in a database for easy recipe management.

### **Food Costing**

Users can create a pantry list of ingredients and their prices, which will be stored in a database. They will then have the ability to cost recipes. As as they select the ingredients and quantities when they are creating the recipe, it will calculate and cost the meal based on the current prices in the database. As ingredient costs fluctuate, user can update the prices in the database, which will automatically update the recipe costings.
